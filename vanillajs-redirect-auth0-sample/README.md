# Auth0 + Vanilla JS + API Seed

This is the seed project you need to use if you're going to create a vanilla JS app that will use Auth0 and an API that you're going to be developing. That API can be in any language.

To see the example working, just go to http://auth0.github.io/auth0-vanillajs-api-sample/

If you're going to use jQuery, you can then check [this other seed](https://github.com/auth0/auth0-jquery-api-sample).

__Note:__ This seed project uses Lock's [redirect mode](https://github.com/auth0/docs/blob/master/articles/libraries/lock/authentication-modes.md)

## Running the example

In order to run the example you need to just start a server. What we suggest is doing the following:

1. Install node
2. run `npm install -g serve` 
3. run `serve` in the directory of this project.

Go to `http://localhost:3000` and you'll see the app running :).
